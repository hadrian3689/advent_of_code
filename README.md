# Advent Of Code Challenges
This is my journey and personal challenge of finishing the Advent Of Code challenges. The goal here is to just learn and have fun while you have fun laughing at my ~~beautiful~~ code.

I am not a programmer, or developer, in any way. So if you think my code and implementation is bad, then you are probably right. I can't prove it but no, I am not going to be using chatGPT.
